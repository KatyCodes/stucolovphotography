      <h2>about</h2>
        <p>
          Based out of Portland Oregon Dimitri Stucolov is a well known landscape photographer. His love of photography started many years ago as a child, he watched in wonder as his uncle created beautiful pieces of art using his camera and film. It wasn't until later in life when Dimitri finally purchased a camera of his own, after graduating from college he set out on a photography road trip that took him all over the western part of the United States. He woke up early and stayed up late, waiting for the light to be just right for his photo. That trip was the first of many photography centric trips that Dimitri would continue to take.
          Dimitri also enjoys spending time with his wife and dog.  When asked why he loves photography he simply states that he photographs "to capture the beautiful moments".
